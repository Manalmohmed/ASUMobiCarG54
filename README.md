# ASUMobiCarG54

Discription:
It is required to develop a Mobile Controlled Car. The car allow easy driving with obstacles avoidance, accurate movement, line tracking. A simple android application is used to control the car.

The project is submitted to DR/ Mohamed Sobh / Control Componenets course / Faculty of Engineering / Ain Shams Universty.

Vision:  
Smartphone - controlled Arduino 2WD robot car or Bluetooth Arduino robot is a car which can move forward and backward, left and right, change its speed.

IDEA:
	Controlling RC cars using android application. 
	Converting a simple toy to a smart one.

Objectives:
	Receiving and sending basic control commands via Bluetooth.
	Allow user to create a certain route for the car.
	Allow the child to learn coding through playing.
	Adding extra options for the toy using sensors (ex: object detection, light sensors, line detector ... etc).
