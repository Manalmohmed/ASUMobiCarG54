**Discription:
It is required to develop a Mobile Controlled Car. The car allow easy driving with obstacles avoidance, accurate movement, line tracking. A simple android application is used to control the car.

The project is submitted to DR/ Mohamed Sobh / Control Componenets course / Faculty of Engineering / Ain Shams Universty.

**Vision:  
Smartphone - controlled Arduino 2WD robot car or Bluetooth Arduino robot is a car which can move forward and backward, left and right, change its speed.

**IDEA:
1-Controlling RC cars using android application. 
2-Converting a simple toy to a smart one.

**Objectives:
1-Receiving and sending basic control commands via Bluetooth.
2-Allow user to create a certain route for the car.
3-Allow the child to learn coding through playing.
4-Adding extra options for the toy using sensors (ex: object detection, light sensors, line detector ... etc).
